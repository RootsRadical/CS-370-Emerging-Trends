I think for me, the way I approach a problem is similar to most people. I want to know all of the details first. 
From there I want to see if there is any operating experience out there of other having a similar issue.
Once I do initial analysis, that's when I start to figure out how to best solve the issue at hand. 
From an ethics standpoint, every developer, computer scientists, or anyone in tech has a responsibility to the end user and the org. 
You want to solve problems and not create additional ones if you can help it. This is why we work in teams and have review processes. 
Mitigating issues from the start of a project is important to its success.
